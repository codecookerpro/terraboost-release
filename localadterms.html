        Local Ad Terms
      </h1>
      <p class="fs-20 fw-bold mb-4">
        The sole parties to this Agreement, <a href="./index.php">Terraboost Media LLC</a> (hereinafter “TBM”), and the
        party named below as “Advertiser”, hereby agree as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          This Agreement, which for all purposes hereof shall be deemed to include these Contract Order Terms &
          Conditions, the Contract Order set forth on the reverse side, and any additional terms and conditions as may
          be
          set forth pursuant to Section 16, contains the parties’ full and complete agreement and understanding with
          respect to the subject matter hereof.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>This Agreement may not be canceled by Advertiser and, except as expressly provided herein, amounts paid by
            Advertiser, including, without limitations, production fees or charges, are not refundable, in whole or in
            part,
            in each case, for any reason.</b> Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, this Agreement
          may
          not
          be canceled by Advertiser and, except as expressly provided herein. Amounts paid by Advertiser are not
          refundable, in whole or in part, as a result of or in connection with the location of the kiosk within the
          venue, whether or not there are always wipes stocked in the kiosk, including the direction it faces (both of
          which will be determined by TBM in its sole discretion), the timing of installation, actions, taken or omitted
          to be taken by venue owners, venue patrons or other third parties (including, without limitation, with respect
          to the maintenance or stocking of the kiosk), any failure by the Advertiser to comply with its obligations
          hereunder (including, without limitation, with respect to its obligations to timely provide Ad Copy or other
          art, graphics or information) and actions taken by or on behalf of TBM as a result of such non-compliance,
          sales
          or other leads generated by the advertisements not meeting Advertiser’s expectations (see, specifically,
          Section
          14), the Advertiser not receiving or maintaining a copy of the Agreement following its execution hereof, or
          the
          Advertiser’s desire to cancel this Agreement for any other reason.
        </li>
        <li>
          TBM shall have the right to terminate this Agreement without liability of any kind to Advertiser and to retain
          all funds previously paid to it hereunder and collect all funds owed to it hereunder with respect to the
          then-current term of this Agreement in the event of a breach of this Agreement by the Advertiser, including,
          without limitation, any non-payment of funds when due, check provided with insufficient funds for coverage or
          challenge of a credit card payment, which is not cured within ten (10) days after written notice thereof is
          provided to the Advertiser. The rights and remedies of TBM hereunder are cumulative and in addition to all
          other
          rights and remedies available to TBM at law or in equity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser agrees to provide Ad Copy (or any necessary logos, images and verbiage for TBM to produce said Ad
          Copy) (“Ad Copy”) to TBM within two (2) weeks of the date of this Agreement, and TBM shall submit Ad Copy
          proof
          for Advertiser approval. Advertiser agrees to return proof approval, or any request for changes, to TBM within
          five (5) business days of receipt of proof. Advertiser is limited to one corrected Ad Copy proof, with
          additional ad copy changes billable at $50 per change. <b>If Advertiser fails to provide Ad Copy, or return
            proof
            approval or request for changes, within the applicable time frames set forth above, TBM is hereby
            authorized,
            in
            TBM’s sole discretion, to use submitted proof, if any, as approved Ad Copy for publication and insertion or
            substitute a generic advertisement of TBM’s choice listing Advertiser as the sponsor, in lieu of custom
            advertisement.</b> Advertiser will be required to pay TBM an additional production fee of $250 to replace
          any
          advertisement placed by Advertiser pursuant to the preceding sentence with a new advertisement provided by
          Advertiser in accordance with the procedures described above. Advertiser understands and agrees that because
          of
          differences in equipment, paper, inks and other conditions between color proofing and production operations, a
          reasonable variation in color between proofs and the final advertisement published and inserted is to be
          expected and is hereby considered acceptable by Advertiser. TBM reserves the right to make modifications to
          Advertiser’s ad copy in order to meet the approval of Venue partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser agrees to have TBM place Advertiser’s advertisements as specified in, and in accordance with, this
          Agreement. Advertiser agrees that any advertisements created by TBM, and all rights pertaining thereto (other
          than with respect to the marks and other intellectual property of Advertiser), shall be vested in and be the
          property of TBM, and may not be used by or on behalf of Advertiser or any agent or affiliate thereof without
          TBM’s prior written consent, which may be granted, withheld or conditioned in TBM’s sole discretion
          (including,
          without limitation, that such consent may be conditioned upon the payment to TBM of a “transfer fee”
          determined
          by TBM in its sole discretion).
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser understands and agrees that the installation of the advertisement(s) is conditioned upon, among
          other
          things, the timing of receipt of acceptable Ad Copy, the timing of approval and subsequent publishing, and the
          final acceptance of Ad Copy by the applicable venue. The normal Production-Cycle, Approved Art cut-off date is
          the 13th of each month with installation scheduled for the first half of the following month, or in the case
          of
          ads in pharmacies, up to two months later, as may be necessary for final approval. However, notwithstanding
          the
          foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Agreement,
          Advertiser acknowledges that the actual timing of installation is uncertain and depends on a number of
          conditions, and a delay in performance by TBM for any reason shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement so
          long as TBM is acting in good faith. The term of the subject advertising publication (Campaign Term) shall
          begin
          upon actual installation; provided, however, that, if the Advertiser does not timely comply with its
          obligations
          under Section 4 hereof, the Campaign Term shall be deemed to commence on the earlier of (a) the date which is
          thirty (30) days after the date of acceptance of this Agreement by TBM or (b) the date of installation of a
          submitted proof advertisement or generic advertisement, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 4 hereof, and
          in
          each case, Advertiser shall not be entitled to any refund or other rights or remedies in connection therewith.
          Advertiser will be notified upon installation of the final, published advertisement(s). Each advertising
          design
          change request shall be subject to a non-refundable production charge of $250. Advertiser shall not be
          permitted
          to distribute materials of any kinds onto kiosk such as business cards or brochures, for example, without
          contracting for this service separately.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser acknowledges that it is aware that TBM has expended and incurred significant resources and expenses
          in connection with the procurement of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the payment by TBM of
          commissions and similar fees. Accordingly, Advertiser agrees not to challenge any payment made hereunder,
          whether by credit card, check or ACH, except in the case of a material breach of this Agreement by TBM which
          is
          not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is provided to TBM at its principal executive
          office.
        </li>
        <li>
          TBM shall not be liable for failure to perform under this Agreement if due to any labor disputes, strikes,
          war,
          fire, flood, accident, materials, loss of a venue from its advertising network, or other shortages, or any act
          of God or other conditions or circumstances beyond TBM’s control. In such case, TBM may, in its sole
          discretion,
          extend the time for performance, substitute other similar venues, or credit pro rata amount to the Advertiser
          (provided, however, that any production fee or charge, whether paid at contract signing or pursuant to Section
          4
          or 6 or otherwise, shall not be subject to such credit or taken into account for purposes of determining the
          amount of the pro rata credit). Advertiser acknowledges and agrees that for the purposes of allocating the
          fees
          charged hereunder, in the case of a Combo advertisement placement (Top & Front combination), the Top board is
          allocated at 80% of the total price (less the non-refundable production charge) and the Front board is
          allocated
          at 20% of the total price (less the non-refundable production charge).
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertisement content may not contain any obscene, defamatory, offensive, controversial, political, or
          religious
          verbiage or images, and/or violate any intellectual property rights of others or invade personal rights to
          privacy, or other personal economic rights. In addition, TBM reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
          whether
          on behalf of itself or the applicable venue, to reject any content and Advertiser hereby agrees to replace
          said
          content with content that meets the approval of TBM in accordance with this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser agrees to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless TBM and its managers, members, officers,
          employees, agents, representatives and other affiliates, and each of their respective assigns and affiliates,
          from, against and in respect of, any and all liabilities, damages, losses, taxes, costs and expenses,
          including,
          without limitation, attorneys’ and other third party (including, without limitation, collection agency) fees
          and
          costs, arising from, in connection with or incident to: (a) any breach or threatened breach of any provision
          of
          this Agreement, including, without limitation, non-payment, late payment, check provided with insufficient
          funds
          for coverage, or challenge of a credit card payment; (b) any other act or omission by or on behalf of
          Advertiser
          or its affiliates; and (c) any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, demands, assessments, judgments,
          settlements, costs and expenses incidental to any of the foregoing, including, without limitation, claims
          based
          on violation of a third party’s intellectual property rights. The indemnity obligations of Advertiser shall
          survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser understands and agrees that TBM may provide advertising space to businesses that are competitive to
          Advertiser (“competitive advertising”), and that such competitive advertising may be in the same venue,
          provided, however that no Advertising for competitors (for example, 2 realtors) shall be placed on the same
          kiosk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser agrees to keep any information provided by TBM confidential and to not approach or communicate with
          venue personnel or contractors regarding this Agreement. Advertiser agrees to pay TBM $5,000 for every breach
          of
          this Section 13 as liquidated damages and not a penalty and agrees that such amount is reasonable. In
          addition,
          in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Section 13, TBM will be entitled to seek equitable
          relief, including an injunction or specific performance (without posting any bond and without proof of actual
          damages), in addition to all other remedies hereunder, at law or in equity. Advertiser agrees not to make
          statements or representations, or otherwise communicate, directly or indirectly, in writing, orally, or
          otherwise, or take any action which may, directly or indirectly, disparage TBM. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
          nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Advertiser from making truthful statements that are required by
          applicable law, regulation or legal process.
        </li>
        <li>
          TBM expressly disclaims all representation and warranties with respect to this Agreement and its services
          hereunder, except those expressly contained herein. TBM makes no guarantees concerning the ultimate value to
          Advertiser of the advertising services. <b>TBM’s total liability to Advertiser from all causes of action shall
            not
            exceed the amounts paid to TBM under this Agreement. TBM shall not be liable under any circumstances for any
            special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages, including, without limitation, lost
            profits.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser represents and warrants that the number being provided is Advertiser’s mobile phone number and
          consents to receiving SMS (i.e., text) messages including via automated technology to this number regarding
          product offers by or on behalf of TBM or any of its subsidiaries, as well as to communicate with Advertiser
          about any issue regarding Advertiser’s advertising or, payment or collections issues, any other matter of
          business between Advertiser and TBM and/or any other matter TBM deems relevant. Advertiser understands SMS
          communication may include contact from companies working on TBM’s behalf. Advertiser understands that consent
          is
          not required to make a purchase. Advertiser also agrees to the Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy.
          Message and Data rates may apply. Advertiser may contact TBM at any time to opt out of this service.
        </li>
        <li>
          Advertiser understands and agrees that the terms and conditions set forth at <a href="./localadterms.html">www.terraboost.com/localadterms</a>
          (or
          any other URL identified by TBM from time to time) (the “Terms of Service”) are incorporated by reference
          herein
          and, together with the other terms and conditions set forth herein, govern the relationship of the parties
          with
          respect to the subject matter hereof. Advertiser acknowledges that he, she or it has read and understands the
          Terms of Service and accepts the Terms of Service. Advertiser further understands and agrees that the Terms of
          Service are subject to change from time to time in TBM’s sole discretion and is encouraged to review the Terms
          of Service periodically. If TBM updates or changes the Terms of Service, the updated or changed Terms of
          Service
          will be posted at <a href="./localadterms.html">www.terraboost.com/localadterms</a> (or any other URL identified by TBM from time to time) and
          TBM
          will notify Advertiser of the posting of the updated or changed Terms of Service. The updated or changed Terms
          of Service will become effective and binding on the next business day after Advertiser is notified of the
          posting thereof. However, in the event of a material change to the Terms of Service, you may object to such
          change by providing written notice to TBM of such objection within thirty (30) days after receiving the notice
          of modification. If you timely provide such notice of objection, the then-posted Terms of Service, without
          giving effect to such material change, will apply for the remainder of the then-current term of this
          Agreement.
          Thereafter, including for any and all renewal periods or terms, the Terms of Service, as posted, will apply.
          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Advertiser understands and agrees that TBM may, in its sole
          discretion, elect to convert its current kiosks to new digital format kiosks, in which case Advertiser’s
          graphics would be subject to conversion to a digital format and be governed by the Terms of Service applicable
          thereto, and posted at <a href="./localadtermsdigital.html">www.terraboost.com/localadtermsdigital</a> (or any
          other URL identified by TBM from time to
          time) as they may be updated or changed from time to time in accordance herewith.
        </li>
        <li>
          This Agreement is subject to acceptance by TBM, which shall occur only upon execution of this Agreement on the
          reverse side by an authorized TBM employee/officer. Advertiser may not assign this Agreement without TBM’s
          prior
          written consent. TBM shall have the right to assign this Agreement at its sole discretion without the
          requirement of notice or consent. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
          laws
          of the State of Florida excluding its conflicts of law rules and principals. Any legal action arising out of
          this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Miami-Dade County,
          Florida, and the parties, by this Agreement, consent to the jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim of
          lack of personal jurisdiction or inconvenient forum with respect to any claim brought in such court.
        </li>
        <li>
          From time to time, TBM may, in its discretion, offer to provide Advertiser with additional services
          (collectively, “Other Services”), which Other Services may include, without limitation, services related to
          “Online Listings Management,” review monitoring, analytics, social media management, social media advertising,
          other online advertising, and other similar services. To the extent any Other Services are offered to, and
          accepted by, Advertiser, the terms and provisions of such Other Services, including, without limitation, the
          term of the agreement pertaining to such Other Services, shall be the same as those set forth in this
          Agreement,
          unless the parties enter into a written addendum or separate agreement governing the Other Services (an “Other
          Services Contract”) and provided that, in any event, the price, if any, to be paid for the Other Services
          shall
          be mutually agreed to by the parties. Subject to the terms and conditions of any applicable Other Services
          Contract, TBM may, in its sole discretion and without any liability to Advertiser or any other person,
          terminate
          or suspend its provision of the Other Services and withhold delivery of materials when this Agreement expires
          or
          terminates or in the event of any late payment, non-payment or any other breach of this Agreement by
          Advertiser.
          Additionally, TBM shall not be liable for any delays or non-performance with respect to its obligations under
          this Agreement or with respect to any Other Services if such delay or non-performance is caused by activities
          or
          factors beyond its reasonable control, including, without limitation, delays and non-performance caused by
          viruses, denial of service, other acts or omissions (including failures to timely or adequately perform) by
          Internet service providers, Advertiser (including failure by Advertiser to timely furnish information or
          approve
          or disapprove work), TBM’s contractors or other third parties, strikes, lockouts, work slowdowns or stoppages,
          accidents, terrorism, fires, natural disasters and other acts of God.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless either (A) Advertiser signs opt out of automatic renewal or (B) Advertiser provides notice of
          non-renewal
          to salessupport@terraboost.com no less than 60 days prior to the end of the then-current term, or (C) TBM
          provides notice of non-renewal to Advertiser no less than 60 days prior to the end of the then current term or
          otherwise terminates this Agreement, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive terms of equal
          duration as the initial term hereof, as specified on the reverse side of this Agreement at, without
          limitation,
          the same price as specified herein. TBM will guarantee space (subject to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement) and charge Advertiser at the same frequency as contracted for herein sixty (60) days prior to the
          commencement of each such renewal term. Advertiser authorizes TBM to charge the credit/debit card or checking
          account specified herein, including any Finance Charge, if applicable, for each renewal payment.
